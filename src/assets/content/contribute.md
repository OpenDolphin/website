# Contribute

At OpenDolphin, we believe that everyone can contribute. Our goal is to build a platform entirely with the support
of the community.

You don't need to be a software engineer or a designer to contribute. We welcome ideas from anyone who wants to help us make our platform better.

## Get in touch

Our [Slack instance](https://join.slack.com/t/open-dolphin/shared_invite/zt-1moz005y9-x0LwnR7Dlvwlmi1jOrkFug) can be used
to get in touch with the community, share your ideas and learn more about what we're working on.  
  
[Here](https://github.com/OpenDolphin/introduction/issues/3) we're collecting a list of users who are committed to the project, it's a
good place to introduce yourself and show your interest.

## Coordination

We have a [GitHub organization](https://github.com/OpenDolphin) where we will be storing all the:
- code
- designs
- ideas
- information about the project
- [roadmaps](https://github.com/orgs/OpenDolphin/projects/1)
- discussions

For the rest, we'll use Slack.

## Software Engineers / Software Developers

Since we're mostly focused on the product at the moment, we don't really have any meaningful repos so far
(although I'll probably share soon a small PoC).  
Your contribution is welcome on Slack or on the [architecture](https://github.com/OpenDolphin/architecture) repository!

## Web Designer

You can improve _this_ website! Check it out on the [website](https://github.com/OpenDolphin/website) repository.

## Designers

If you're interested in helping us with branding or UI/UX, let us know! Designers are always welcome!

You can for example check the following repositories:

- [brand](https://github.com/openDolphin/brand): the brand identity of OpenDolphin
- [product-design](https://github.com/OpenDolphin/product-design): the design of the product

## Investors

If you're interested in being an investor (which we recommend), send us a message on Slack, and we'll get back to you as soon as possible!
