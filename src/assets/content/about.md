# What is OpenDolphin?

OpenDolphin is a project whose goal is to build a community-owned, privacy-first and centralized social network for everyone. 
A place where users come first and the community is invited to participate in creating a better platform for everyone.
We want to build a social network that is not only private and secure, but also: fair, not-for-profit, democratic and censorship resistant.
  

We want to make it centralized for the following reasons:
- Avoiding "identity theft" (multiple usernames on different federated instances)
- Solving content discovery issues
- Improving indexing / search
- Provide a reliable infrastructure
- Verify accounts (public figures)
- Enhance post authenticity checks (via a [PKI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure)?)
- ...

# The Idea

We want to build a new social network, similar to the existing ones (Facebook, Instagram and Twitter) but
built and managed entirely by the community.  
We're planning to [build it in public](https://www.failory.com/blog/building-in-public) and keep everything 
completely transparent (within the limits imposed by the law and data-privacy regulations). On top of that,
we want everyone to be able to contribute (ideas, code, design, ...) and be a part of the journey.

## Main Concept

The main concept to keep in mind when reading anything about OpenDolphin is that _everything can be changed_, including this
page. We really want to shape together this project - and for this reason we consider the initial work done to be just a 
guidance on how the project should look like.  
  
If you don't like certain parts of the project (or the project on its entirety), you are free to [contribute](#contribute)
and help us make it the way you like!

## Social Network

The goal of this project is to have a product (that we're temporarily calling "OpenDolphin", see [The Name & Brand](#the-name--brand)) 
which we hope will become the next generation social media platform.

Among the features we plan to have we might have:

- Privacy-first and secure platform
    - E2E Direct Messages
    - Signed posts (sort of Keybase / [KeyOxide](https://keyoxide.org/)) 
- Transparent Content Moderation
    - Fact Checking by the community
- Welcoming Environment
- Censorship resistant (might be challenging for certain countries, but it's a nice goal to have)

Of course the platform will not be a free-for-all, as we plan to remove:

- Content that is breaking the law (TODO: figure out which law) like:
    - Child Porn
    - Copyrighted Content
    - ...

We might decide to not remove hate speech (?), but the community should definitely have a way to
de-prioritize this form of content on the platform. 

## Company

There is currently no legal entity behind the project, but with enough funding we might build one. 
Unfortunately for certain things (e.g: owning a domain, having an AWS account, being held responsible for some content, GDPR, ...)
we _need_ a company behind the product.  
  
This effectively means that the OpenDolphin project will most probably have an OpenDolphin Company / Foundation in the future,
but we plan to have this entity completely transparent.

### No "CEO"

Amount our plans there is the idea of not having a CEO (figuratively). The ownership of the product shouldn't be of the company, and
thus the CEO (or anyone else) should be able to have a saying in how the product should operate. This should be entirely up to the community.  
  
For decisions that might actually have a legal impact, the "power of the CEO" will have to be defined during the definition of the "Open Company".

# The Community

We believe that people should be in charge of everything related to this project. 
Our belief is that _anyone_ should be able to give their contribution and contribute to shaping the product.
In case of conflicting opinions, we collect opinions and arguments, and then we vote, in a democratic way.

## Retribution

Everyone needs to be retributed for their part on the project in function of their effort put to bring the project to life.
The revenue of the platform will be distributed among all contributors, so that everyone benefits from the work they put into this project.
  
This effectively means that the success of the platform will bring more money to the people who contributed.

# The Revenue

We don't have yet a precise goal on how to monetize the platform, and we would like your ideas!
Check the [Contribute](/contribute) page and see how you can possible help us shape the [product definition](https://github.com/OpenDolphin/product-definition/)!  
  
What we can plan so far is to re-invest the money we get from the monetization features to
pay the contributors (you!) and pay for the infrastructure bills (e.g: AWS?).


# The Name & Brand

If you don't like the _OpenDolphin_ name, don't worry! As with everything else in this project, the name
is not definitive. It will be up to the community to help us find the name for the product.  
  
If you already have a better idea, [brand](https://github.com/OpenDolphin/brand) is the repository you're looking for.

# Contribute

Enough chit-chat. We want you to help us out!
